# Awesome AI Trading Research [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> Academic research on system trading, quantitative finance, and AI/ML-powered trading, curated and tier-ranked from arXiv.

A curated reading list of the strongest recent papers on **system trading**, **quantitative finance**, and
**AI/ML-powered trading**. The full list, grouped by sub-domain and tier, is in [papers.md](papers.md), and the
research landscape is mapped in [research-map.md](research-map.md).

## How This List Is Built

The goal is a high-signal reading list: only papers a quant researcher would genuinely want to read.
Candidate papers are collected daily from arXiv (with a monthly backfill of older months) and filtered for
genuine finance/trading relevance. Each is then **pre-scored** 0–100 on five dimensions — novelty, applicability,
rigor, reproducibility, and insight — with domain-specific weights, yielding a composite score and tier (S/A/B/C/D)
computed in code.

Before any paper appears here, its S/A pre-score is **re-evaluated with a frontier model and reviewed and approved
by a human curator** at [OHSE AI Lab](https://ohselab.com). Only the approved S- and A-tier papers are published;
lower tiers stay internal. Entities (methods, concepts, datasets) are extracted and clustered into the research
themes below. Currently publishing **3 S-tier** and **751 A-tier** papers.
